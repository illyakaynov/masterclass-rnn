    "# Contextualized Embeddings with a Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks, we have used the Word2Vec model to learn the embeddings from the text. The embeddings are learned in the unsupervised setting, by predicting the word given the context (or the context given a word). While these embeddings are quite useful, they have one major downside: once learned, they are separated from the context. A single word can mean different things when surrounded by different words. For example, the word \"transformer\" could refer to an electrical device, Optimus Prime, or neural network architecture. It is impossible to determine the meaning of the word without its context. The idea behind ELMo presented in [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05365.pdf) utilizes this idea and forms **contextualized embeddings** for the word taking into account its neighbors. It does so by employing bi-directional LSTM, which looks at words that came before and after to form the embeddings. As we have already learned recurrent neural networks are very hard to train due to the backpropagation through time. This brings to major downsides of the RNN: 1) not being able to utilize parallel computations and 2) difficulty with retaining long-term dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the release of the Transformer paper, called [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), this architecture started to dominate the NLP world. The Transformer architecture is parallelizable, which allows the utilization of multiple GPUs and TPUs, and also it can model long-term relationships with the novel attention mechanism. Unfortunately, we are not able to dive deep into the topics of transformers, since they deserve their own Masterclass (or two).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to understand better how the transformer works or why is it so good for modeling long-term dependencies, check a visual description of the transformers here: https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a specific transformer architecture called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The original paper from Google Research can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf. For a more informal and visual guide check out Illustrated BERT: http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to have a look at how we can use pre-trained BERT for a custom classification task. We are going to use [`transformers`](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/) package from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html). There we can find a great amount of pre-trained models that are easily reusable and fine-tunable to almost any NLP task. Thanks to the Abhishek Thakur and his [book](https://www.amazon.com/Approaching-Almost-Machine-Learning-Problem-ebook/dp/B089P13QHT) for the inspiration.\n",

The `base` part means this is a smaller model with 12 transformer blocks, 12 attention heads, and 768 dimensions for the Feed Forward Network layer.

The tokenizer has a nice method `encode_plus()` which will take our reviews and return the encoded version."

    "By default, BERT returns two outputs: the last hidden state and the output of the pooler layer. The pooled output is produced by processing all contextual embeddings in a sequence with a Feed-Forward Network. If the last hidden state contains all **contextual embeddings** for each word in a sequence, then the pooler layer is an embedding of a document, or in this case the review. The only thing that is left to do is to train an additional Dense layer to separate these documents into the two categories. You can check out a nice visualization of all embeddings formed by BERT in this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualize-bert-sequence-embeddings-an-unseen-way-1d6a351e4568)."
